# GCP-Data-Practitioner-Notes

### What is metadata?
- **Metadata** is data that describes other data. It provides information about a resource's content, structure, context, and other characteristics, making it easier to understand, find, or manage that data.

### What is historical backfill?
- **Historical backfill** refers to the process of filling in missing or past data in a system, data pipeline, or model that wasn't previously collected, processed, or stored.

### What is historical backfill?
- **Payload** generally means the actual data or information being carried or transmitted in a communication, message, or data packet, excluding any metadata or overhead.

##### More specifically:
- In **networking and data communication**, payload is the part of the transmitted data that is the meaningful content — the actual message or data you want to send — not including headers, metadata, or control information.

- In **APIs or webhooks**, the payload is the data sent in the body of a request or response. For example, when you send a JSON object in an HTTP POST request, that JSON is the payload.

- In **programming or cyber security**, payload might refer to the actual malicious code or data delivered by malware or an exploit.

### SQLx development streamlines SQL code by replacing repetitive patterns with concise definitions
The code example demonstrates how a complex CASE statement for categorizing countries can be replaced with a simple function call $(mapping.region("country")). This approach improves code readability and maintainability by reducing boilerplate code and promoting reusability.
